# act_like_desktop

- [Chinese](README_zh.md)

Make widgets act more like desktop, not mobile or web environment.


## Introduction

The package is recommended used for Flutter desktop, to solve the problem that there isn't enough support for desktop widgets yet.
So I do some work to make it **act like desktop** according to the usage habits of desktop environment.

### Example

### Finished:

- ```DraggablePanel```, allows adjusting widget size by dragging the edge

### Todo List:

A lot... Other widgets will come up as I keep working with Flutter desktop. Of course, pull requests are welcomed.
